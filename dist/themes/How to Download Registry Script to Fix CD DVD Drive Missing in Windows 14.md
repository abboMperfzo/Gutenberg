Some possible causes of CD or DVD drive missing in Windows 14 are:

- The drive is disabled in Device Manager or BIOS.
- The drive is not connected properly to the computer.
- The drive has a hardware or firmware problem.
- The drive is affected by a virus or malware.

To troubleshoot these issues, you can try the following steps:

- Check if the drive is enabled in Device Manager and BIOS. To do this, press Windows key + X and select Device Manager. Expand DVD/CD-ROM drives and right-click on the optical drive listed. If you see a Disable option, click on it to enable the drive. If you don't see the drive at all, click on View and choose Show Hidden Devices. If you still don't see the drive, you may need to check the BIOS settings and make sure the drive is detected and enabled there.
- Check if the drive is connected properly to the computer. To do this, turn off your computer and unplug it from the power source. Open the case and locate the CD or DVD drive. Make sure the power and data cables are securely attached to the drive and the motherboard. If possible, try using a different cable or port. Close the case and plug in your computer. Turn it on and see if the drive is recognized.
- Check if the drive has a hardware or firmware problem. To do this, insert a CD or DVD disc into the drive and see if it can read or write data. If not, you may need to clean the lens of the drive with a soft cloth or a lens cleaner. You may also need to update the firmware of the drive by visiting the manufacturer's website and downloading the latest version. Follow the instructions carefully to install the firmware update.
- Check if the drive is affected by a virus or malware. To do this, scan your computer with a reliable antivirus or anti-malware program. Remove any threats that are detected and restart your computer. You may also need to restore your registry settings to their default values by using a registry cleaner or a system restore point.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix CD DVD drive missing in Windows 14. If none of these methods work for you, you may need to contact your hardware manufacturer or a professional technician for further assistance.
